# Database Lab Projects – SQL Practice

This repository contains my university database lab projects, where I worked on **ER modeling, normalization, SQL queries, transactions, and views**.  
The work was completed collaboratively in **Team 12**.

---

##  Lab 2 – ER Modeling
- Designed ER diagrams for given schemas.
- Transformed ER models into relational schemas.
- Defined primary & foreign keys.
Report: `database-lab2-normalization-sql.pdf`
---

##  Lab 3 – Normalization & SQL
- Identified functional dependencies and candidate keys.
- Normalized relations up to **3NF** to remove redundancy.
- Implemented schemas in SQL with **PKs and FKs**.
- Wrote SQL queries for:
  - Joins across multiple tables  
  - Selection & projection queries  
  - Aggregation queries on weather dataset (temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity).

##  Lab 4 – Transactions & Views
- Implemented **transactions** with `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`.
- Designed and tested **SQL views** to combine data from multiple tables.
- Checked which operations are possible through views (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
- Wrote SQL queries on sample **Geography** and **Company** databases.

##  Skills Demonstrated
- ER Modeling & Database Design  
- Normalization (up to 3NF)  
- SQL Queries (Selection, Join, Aggregation)  
- Transactions & Rollback  
- SQL Views & Data Abstraction

##  Note
These are **academic lab projects** completed as part of my **Databases course** at HAW Hamburg. They demonstrate my **practical SQL knowledge** and database design skills.
